## The Problem

Many productivity setups rely on external devices like phones or dedicated timers to track focus sessions. This often leads to context switching and distraction. Focus Timer solves this by bringing a simple, unobtrusive timer directly onto your primary screen, floating above any application you're working in.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Always-On-Top Overlay**: The timer floats above all other windows, ensuring it's always visible while you work, code, or design.
*   **Full Customization**: Tailor the timer's appearance to your liking.
    *   **Color Picker**: Change the background and text color to match your wallpaper or theme.
    *   **Font Size**: Adjust the timer's size from subtle to prominent.
*   **Flexible Positioning**: Place the timer anywhere on your screen with a 9-point positioning grid (Top-Left, Center, Bottom-Right, etc.).
*   **Lightweight & Minimal**: No unnecessary features. Just a timer to keep you on track.
*   **Free & Open Source**: Built with transparency and community in mind.

## 🚀 Download & Installation

1.  Go to the [**Focus Timer Website**](https://focustimer.dev2th3core.site) or the [**GitHub Releases**](https://github.com/dev2th3core/FocusTimer/releases) page.
2.  Download the latest `FocusTimer.exe` file.
3.  Run the executable. No installation is required!

> **Note:** Windows SmartScreen might show a warning because the application is not code-signed. You can bypass this by clicking "More info" and then "Run anyway".

## 📖 How to Use

1.  **Launch the App**: Open `FocusTimer.exe`.
2.  **Set Duration**: Use the circular slider to select your desired focus duration.
3.  **Start Focus**: Click the "Start Focus" button. The main window will minimize, and the timer overlay will appear.
4.  **Manage Timer**:
    *   To **Stop**, **Pause**, or **Restart** the timer, restore the main window from your taskbar.
    *   The overlay is click-through, so it won't interfere with your work.
